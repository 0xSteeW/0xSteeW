# 0xSteeW (Daniel PÃ©rez)

## Who am I?

Hello! My name is Daniel. I'm a 18 year old spanish boy. I live in Madrid, an currently I'm starting the second year of Telecommunications Engineering in the Polythecnic University of Madrid.

## What do I do?
I am a self learner. As such, I like tinkering with new languages, modifying all my hardware, customizing and distro hopping Linux... I am really interested in learning new things.

In respect to coding, I like toying with Linux and some libraries, making bots, (trying to) create webpages... I am ready to try any challenge that it's in front of me! :)

## What languages do I use?

I really like compiled languages. So most of my code is written in either Go or C++. In the future I would like to learn *new* languages like Kotlin or Rust that are really rising nowadays. I'm really interested in Haskell for the change of paradigm that it offers from conventional languages, so I expect to take a look at it someday.

## Current interests
If you have an open source project and need some help hit me up. I would be willing to work in bigger projects to gain experience and to do some team work.
